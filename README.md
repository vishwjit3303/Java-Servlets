## Java Servlets are server-side Java programs that handle requests and responses in a web application. They extend the capabilities of servers by generating dynamic content and can be used to build complex web applications. Hereâ€™s an overview:

## Key Concepts of Java Servlets
- Servlet Lifecycle:

- Initialization (init): Called once when the servlet is created.
- Request Handling (service): Called for each request, handling both GET and POST requests.
Destruction (destroy): Called when the servlet is being removed from service, typically at server shutdown.
Structure:

- Servlets are Java classes that extend the HttpServlet class.
They use methods like doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete to handle different HTTP methods.
Working of a Servlet:

- The client (e.g., a web browser) sends a request to the server.
The server routes this request to the appropriate servlet.
The servlet processes the request, interacts with databases or other backend services if necessary, and generates a response.
This response is sent back to the client.

### Deployment:

- Servlets are typically deployed in a Java web server or servlet container, like Apache Tomcat, Jetty, or GlassFish.
They are packaged as .war files (Web Application Archive) for deployment.
Servlet API Components:

- HttpServletRequest: Encapsulates the request details (headers, parameters, etc.).
HttpServletResponse: Used to construct and send the response (content type, status code, etc.).
ServletConfig and ServletContext: Provide configuration and context information.

### Advantages of Servlets:

- Performance: Efficient because they are multithreaded; each request runs in a separate thread rather than a new process.
- Portability: As a part of Java EE, servlets run on any Java-enabled web server.
- Scalability: Easily integrates with other Java technologies and scales well with complex applications.
